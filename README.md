## My Takeaways :

It's a field of great interest nowadays and comes as a useful tool in several applications. Coming from a traditional engineering background where I routinely use physics based modeling to understand and interpret the world; deep learning methods add valuable skills and understanding and help me stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the industry.


- Deep learning involves experimentation, testing, and tuning to get the best results. Helps me with problem solving and is valuable in my studies and career.


- Deep learning is a rapidly evolving field, with new techniques and applications being developed all the time. Studying deep learning provides me  opportunities for research and contributes to the advancement of the field.


- Nowadays deep learning is attempted in every field whether it's really required or not! So helps me with critical thinking; to know whether it's a bane or a boon in a given situation.   


It was an intellectually stimulating experience and helped me develop a deeper understanding of the field, the tools and resources. When I started I had very limited idea about various open source or free tools like Jupyter notebook or PyTorch, various open source libraries etc. (*actually struggled a bit coming up to speed with the basic set up and stuff!*) and did not know much outside of Deep learning using MATLAB which is a proprietary tool and lacks the amount of resources and options and examples that open source nowadays has.


 Thank you!
